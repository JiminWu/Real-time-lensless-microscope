# Real-time-lensless-microscope
The codes for the real-time lensless microscope ([link](https://link-to-be-updated)), proposed in:

**to be updated**: "A real-time, deep-learning aided lensless microscope", Jimin Wu, Vivek Boominathan, Ashok Veeraraghavan* and Jacob T. Robinson*

</sub> * Corresponding authors </sub>

### Requirements
python 3.8+
pytorch 1.7+

### Pre-trained model
The pre-trained model can be downloaded here: (Google Drive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G-uBnOX-nSZ1aTTI0V3h_RZmSD3sBM5y/view?usp=share_link))

### Included Examples
We provide several exapmles of similated (.png) data with ground truth and real captured data (.mat) in /sample_data/, along with the corresponding point spread functions (.mat). Run 

### Real-time GUI
Current GUI works with ImagingSource DMM 37UX178-ML board-level camera (see more at ImagingSource support [link](https://github.com/TheImagingSource/IC-Imaging-Control-Samples/tree/master/Python)). qt5-simple.py provides a live stream test of the camera.
